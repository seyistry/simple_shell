.SH NAME

.B simple_shell - hsh
- command line interpreter or shell


.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh
.I (no options yet)



.SH DESCRIPTION

A command line interpreter, or shell, called simple shell follows in the footsteps of Ken Thompson's original Unix shell. Although this shell is purposefully simple, it nevertheless has the essential features of a conventional Unix-like command line interface. Simple shell is built for the Linux operating system. 

.SH OVERVIEW

Simple shell reads commands from either files or the terminal and then interprets and executes them.


.SH INVOCATION

Compile simple shell using the GNU Compiler Collection, preferably with gcc and the following settings, as shown in this example (notice the usage of the * wildcard to permit concurrent compilation of all related.c files):
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
By typing the following command on the command line, followed by "enter," simple shell can be launched in interactive mode.
Keep in mind that the prompt ($) will appear, putting you in interactive mode where you can type commands followed by "enter."
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
simple_shell can be run in non-interactive mode through the use of shell scripts. This can involve the use of piping ('|'):
.P
.RS
.B echo 'pwd' | ./hsh

.SH EXECUTABLES

Example of executables:
.IP
.br
.\&
.RS
\&$ echo "Example of executables"
.br
\&"Example of executables"
.br
\&$
